            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
                Two decimals can be compared using > (greater than), = (equals), and < (less than) symbols. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Greater Than:</h2>
            <p>The greater than symbol (>) is used to show that the number to the left has a higher value than the
                number on the right. If the whole number part (the number to the left of the decimal) of one number is
                equal to the whole number part of the other number, then we must look at the fractional part (the
                number(s) to the right of the decimal) of each and compare them. We start by looking at the tenths
                place, which is the first number after the decimal. <br><br>

                <u>Example 1</u>: Let's compare 1.3 and 1.2. Since both decimals have a whole part of 1, we must compare
                the fractional part of each. The first number has a 3 in the tenths position, while the second number
                has a 2 in the tenths position. Since 3 > 2, we say that 1.3 > 1.2. <br><br>

                Sometimes we must look at the hundredths place, which is the second number after the decimal. <br><br>

                <u>Example 2</u>: Let's compare 1.36 and 1.31. Since both decimals have a whole part of 1, we must
                compare the fractional part of each. We start by looking at the tenths position, which is also the same
                for both numbers. Now we must look at the hundredths position and compare those numbers. The hundredths
                position of the first decimal contains 6, while the hundredths position of the second decimal contains
                1. Since 6 > 1, we say that 1.36 > 1.31.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Less Than:</h2>
            <p> The less than symbol (<) is used to show that the number to the left has a lesser value than the number
                    on the right. We follow a similar process as we did above.<br><br>

                    <u>Example 1</u>: Let's compare 2.2 and 2.9. Since both decimals have a whole part of 2, we must
                    compare the fractional part of each. The first number has a 2 in the tenths position, while the
                    second
                    number has a 9 in the tenths position. Since 2 > 9, we say that 2.2 < 2.9. <br><br>

                        <u>Example 2</u>: Let's compare 3.14. and 3.15. Since both decimals have a whole part of 1, we
                        must compare the fractional part of each. The numbers in the tenths position are also the same
                        for both numbers. Now we must look at the hundredths position and compare those numbers. The
                        hundredths position of the first decimal contains 4, while the hundredths position of the second
                        decimal contains 5. Since 4 > 5, then we say that 3.14 < 3.15. </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Equals:</h2>
            <p> The equals symbol (=) is used to show that two numbers are equal in value. When the whole part and
                fractional part of two decimals are the same, then the decimals are equal. For example, 2.72 = 2.72.
