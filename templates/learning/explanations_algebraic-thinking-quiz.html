            Venusaur begins with 340 HP. After the attack, it has 340 - 250 = 90 HP remaining. The ability heals 60
            damage, so Venusaur gains 60 HP. It now has 90 + 60 = 150 HP.
            {% elif question == "question2" %}
            Brave Wing does 60 base damage plus 100 additional damage, so it does 60 + 100 = 160 damage.
            {% elif question == "question3" %}
            2/9 are Darkness, so 9/9 - 2/9 = 7/9 of your Basic Energy cards are Psychic.
            {% elif question == "question4" %}
            Blastoise takes 30 less damage from attacks due to its Solid Shell Ability. So Charizard's Explosive Vortex
            does 330 - 30 = 300 damage, which is not enough for Blastoise to be Knocked Out. Therefore, the answer is
            False.
            {% elif question == "question5" %}
            15/60 cards are Pok√©mon, so 60/60 - 15/60 = 45/60 are not. 45/60 reduces to 3/4 because both 45 and 60 are
            divisble by 15.
