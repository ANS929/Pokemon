            Avenging Knuckle does 30 base damage plus 120 additional damage. 30 + 120 = 150 damage.
            {% elif question == "question2" %}
            Family Attack does 70 damage per Maushold in play, so it would do 70 * 4 = 280 damage.
            {% elif question == "question3" %}
            Ballistic Beak doees 10 base damage plus 30 more damage per damage counter on your Dodrio. Since Dodrio has
            5 damage counters on it, we multiply 30 * 5 = 150 and add the base damage. 10 + 150 = 160.
            {% elif question == "question4" %}
            Lucario starts with 130 HP but currently has 90 HP left. To find out how much damage it took, we subtract
            130 - 90 = 40 damage.
            {% elif question == "question5" %}
            To find the difference, we subtract the two Pok√©dex numbers. 925 - 448 = 477.
