                <p>We can solve real-world problems by using addition and subtraction.</p>

                <h2>Addition:</h2>
                <p>We will use the same skills discussed in the <a
                        href="{% url 'learning:practice_detail' practice_slug='addition-and-subtraction-of-whole-numbers' %}">Addition
                        and Subtraction of Whole Numbers</a> lesson in the <a
                        href="{% url 'learning:unit_detail' unit_slug='computation' %}">Computation</a> unit, but now we
                    will apply them to real-world problems.</p>
                <p><u>Example</u>: Your are battling your friend. Your active Pokémon has two attacks, one that does 150
                    damage and one that does 200 damage. If you use the first attack on one turn and the second attack
                    on another turn, how much damage will you do in total?</p>
                <p>Your total damage would be the sum of both of your attack's damage output. So, we would add 150 + 200
                    = 350. Your Pokémon will do a total of 350 damage.</p>

                <p><u>Example</u>: Your active Pokémon has 240 HP. Your opponent attacks your Pokémon for 230 damage.
                    What is your active Pokémon's remaining HP?</p>
                <p>Your Pokémon's remaining HP would be its current HP minus how much damage it took. So, we subtract
                    240 - 230 = 10. Your active Pokémon has 10 HP remaining.</p>

                <h2>You Try:</h2>
                <p> Your opponent attacks your Iron Leaves ex with Raging Bolt ex's Bellowing Thunder, discarding 3
                    Basic Energy. Your opponent claims this is enough damage to knock out your Iron Leaves, but you
                    disagree. How many hit points does your Iron Leaves have left after the attack? <b>Click on a card
