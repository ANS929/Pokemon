            Charizard ex has the greatest meta share because it takes up the largest portion of the circle. Chien-Pao
            has the second greatest meta share since it takes up the second largest portion of the circle.
            {% elif question == "question2" %}
            Charizard ex, Chien-Pao ex, and Arceus VSTAR do not quite take up half of the circle, so the answer is
            False.
            {% elif question == "question3" %}
            Snorlax Stall takes up the same portion of the circle as Ancient Box, so they have the same meta share.
            {% elif question == "question4" %}
            Charizard ex does not quite take up a quarter of the circle, so it is not 25%. It is also larger than 10%.
            Therefore, Charizard ex makes up approximately 20% of the meta.
            {% elif question == "question5" %}
            This is True because a bar graph can also be used to display and compare the sizes of data categories.
            {% else %}
            No explanation available.
