        <h1>About the Creator</h1>
        <p>Alex Smith, the creator of PokéMath, is a lifelong learner with a passion for math and Pokémon. She graduated
            from Trine University in 2011 with a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Mathematics Education. After spending
            eight years as a math teacher, Alex transitioned to a career in technology. She completed her Master’s in
            Information Technology at the University of Glasgow in September 2024.</p>
        <p>A Pokémon fan since childhood, Alex began her journey with Pokémon Yellow, a cherished Christmas gift from
            1999. Although she collected cards as a child, she did not learn how to play until she was an adult. In
            2017, she attended a local game store (LGS) in Indianapolis where she learned the rules. Alex enjoys both
            casual and competitive play, having recently competed at the European International Championships (EUIC) in
            London in April 2024.</p>
        <p>Driven by a desire to create an engaging math learning experience, Alex combined her background in education
            with her newly developed programming skills to bring PokéMath to life. Through this project, she sought to
            combine her love for math and Pokémon, inspiring others to pursue their passions and reach for their goals.
            PokéMath embodies Alex's dedication and vision, reflecting her belief that hard work and ambition can lead
            to incredible achievements.</p>
        <p>Pictured below is Alex posing with Pikachu at the North American Internation Championships (NAIC) in 2023.
